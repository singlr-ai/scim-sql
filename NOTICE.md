## ANTLR grammars-v4 PostgreSQL grammar

The PostgreSQL grammar and its Java support sources under
`src/main/antlr4/ai/singlr/postgresql/parser/` and
`src/main/java/ai/singlr/postgresql/parser/` are vendored from the
[ANTLR grammars-v4](https://github.com/antlr/grammars-v4) project.

| | |
|---|---|
| Upstream repository | `https://github.com/antlr/grammars-v4` |
| Upstream path | `sql/postgresql` |
| Pinned commit | `76093c04af6a51f38a67d14f7e71ff0a9b4400da` (2026-06-20) |

Vendored files:

- `PostgreSQLLexer.g4` (from `sql/postgresql/PostgreSQLLexer.g4`)
- `PostgreSQLParser.g4` (from `sql/postgresql/PostgreSQLParser.g4`)
- `COPYRIGHT` (from `sql/postgresql/COPYRIGHT`, verbatim)
- `PostgreSQLLexerBase.java`, `PostgreSQLParserBase.java`,
  `LexerDispatchingErrorListener.java`, `ParserDispatchingErrorListener.java`
  (from `sql/postgresql/Java/`)

The test corpus under `src/test/resources/postgresql-corpus/` is vendored from
`sql/postgresql/examples/` at the same commit. Generated lexer/parser sources are
build output under `target/generated-sources/` and are never hand-edited.

### Local modifications

Every deviation from upstream is listed here and marked with a
`scim-sql local modification` comment at the change site:

1. `PostgreSQLParser.g4` — added `plsqlvariablename` as a labeled `c_expr`
   alternative (`# c_expr_namedparam`) so named parameters (`:start_at`,
   `:user_id`) are first-class expression values.
2. `PostgreSQLParser.g4` — removed `PLSQLVARIABLENAME` from the `identifier`
   rule so `:name` can never be an identifier, alias, or relation name.
3. `PostgreSQLParser.g4` — split `createfunctionstmt` into a header plus
   either the upstream AS-string option list or the PostgreSQL 14+ unquoted
   SQL body (`RETURN expr` / `BEGIN ATOMIC stmt; ... END`), which upstream
   does not parse.
4. `PostgreSQLParser.g4` — closed modern-PostgreSQL gaps against `gram.y`
   (PostgreSQL 14 through 18), each also marked in place:
   `json_aggregate_func` was defined upstream but never referenced (wired
   into `func_expr` / `func_expr_windowless`, and its `json_returning_clause`
   made optional as in `gram.y`); MERGE gained the PostgreSQL 17 `RETURNING`
   clause and `WHEN NOT MATCHED BY SOURCE | BY TARGET`; `group_clause`
   accepts the PostgreSQL 14 `ALL | DISTINCT` set quantifier;
   `common_table_expr` gained the PostgreSQL 14 `SEARCH` and `CYCLE`
   clauses; the PostgreSQL 16 `IS [NOT] JSON` predicate was added to
   `a_expr_is_not`; the PostgreSQL 17 `JSON_TABLE` table function was added
   and wired into `table_ref`; `UNIQUE`/`PRIMARY KEY` constraints accept the
   PostgreSQL 18 `WITHOUT OVERLAPS` marker; `xmltable_column_option_el`
   accepts `PATH` explicitly (the lexer keyword cannot match the generic
   identifier option); `json_format_clause` uses the real `FORMAT` token —
   upstream's `FORMAT_LA` literal is Bison lookahead-token residue that
   never occurs in SQL text, so `FORMAT JSON` could never parse.
5. `PostgreSQLLexer.g4` — fixed the upstream `BREADTH: 'BREATH'` typo that
   made `SEARCH BREADTH FIRST` unparseable.
6. `PostgreSQLLexerBase.java` — `nextToken()` splits a greedy
   `PLSQLVARIABLENAME` match into `COLON` plus the re-lexed name whenever the
   previous default-channel token can end an expression, so JSON `key:value`
   separators and array-slice bounds (`arr[lo:hi]`) written without
   whitespace stay operators instead of becoming named parameters.
7. `PostgreSQLLexerBase.java` — nested block comments are lexed iteratively
   with a depth counter instead of the upstream recursive rule, which was
   quadratic-time and could overflow the stack on adversarial nesting.
8. `*.java` support files — added a
   `package ai.singlr.postgresql.parser;` declaration (upstream files have no
   package). The files are excluded from code formatting to keep them
   diffable against upstream.

Known consequences of the `:name` named-parameter extension:

- A colon directly after `[` binds to the parameter extension, so
  `arr[:name]` is a subscript by named parameter, not a slice with an
  omitted lower bound. Slices with an expression lower bound (`arr[lo:hi]`,
  `arr[1:2]`) are unaffected.
- The `:"identifier"` PL/SQL form is rejected.

### Expected grammar warnings

Upstream ships two benign ANTLR warning-146 lexer rules
(`AfterEscapeStringConstantMode_NotContinued` and
`AfterEscapeStringConstantWithNewlineMode_NotContinued`). These are pinned by
`GrammarWarningsTest`; the build fails on any new grammar warning or error.

### Upgrading the grammar

1. Pick a new upstream commit and re-copy the files listed above.
2. Re-apply the local modifications (search for `scim-sql local modification`).
3. Update the pinned commit here and in `UpstreamCorpusTest`, refresh the
   corpus files, and run `mvn clean verify`. Review any change in
   `GrammarWarningsTest` expectations deliberately.
